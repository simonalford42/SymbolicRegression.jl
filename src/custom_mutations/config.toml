# Custom Mutations Configuration
# ================================
# This file configures mutation weights for both built-in and custom mutations.
# Weights are relative (they get normalized), so you can use any scale.
# Set a weight to 0.0 to disable that mutation.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BUILT-IN MUTATION WEIGHTS (PySR defaults)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These are the standard PySR mutations. Adjust these for hyperparameter tuning.

mutate_constant = 0.0353      # Randomly perturb a constant's value
mutate_operator = 3.63        # Change one operator to another (e.g., + to *)
mutate_feature = 0.1          # Change which input variable a leaf references
swap_operands = 0.00608       # Swap left/right children of a binary operator
rotate_tree = 1.42            # Tree rotation (restructure without changing semantics)
add_node = 0.0771             # Append/prepend a random operator to a leaf
insert_node = 2.44            # Insert an operator at a random position
delete_node = 0.369           # Remove a random operator, keeping one child
simplify = 0.00148            # Algebraic simplification (e.g., x*1 -> x)
randomize = 0.00695           # Replace tree with a completely random one
do_nothing = 0.431            # Keep tree unchanged (helps with selection pressure)
optimize = 0.0                # Run constant optimization (expensive)

# CUSTOM MUTATION WEIGHTS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Custom mutations are loaded from .jl files in this directory.
# The key should match the filename (without .jl extension).
# Set weight > 0 to enable, 0 to disable.

[custom_mutations]
# Example mutation: adds a constant offset to a random subtree
add_constant_offset = 0.5

# Slots for additional LLM-generated mutations (add as needed)
# mutation_2 = 0.0
# mutation_3 = 0.0
# mutation_4 = 0.0
# mutation_5 = 0.0
